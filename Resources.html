                This is a list of resources that I think are great for anyone interested in Cv2.

                Just to note, the order isn't in beginner to advanced, it's what I personally find more useful. Beginners may find some of the entries complicated, so be warned!

                        RecRoomCircuits is still a WIP site, yet accomplishes so much already. Currently, it's great to look at circuits outside of Rec Room since it visualizes every chip. It's mostly up-to-date, and with easy-to-remember URLs to chips, you can send anyone asking about a certain chip a link quickly. It also has a short description for each circuit, allowing you to learn easily without going in-game.

                        CircuitsV2Resources is a site that contains many links to resources created by Rec Room itself and by players, letting users choose what may best suit their learning needs. Since it's maintained by a developer at Rec Room, it's not always up-to-date. It does get updates somewhat regularly though, so it's generally good enough.
